The two main areas of development of the code were:

1)  Altering the output data from the status register.

2)  Setting up the test cases for the ls138_chip.c file.

In altering the output data the three keys were to invert the 7th bit so that
data would be accurate for the ls138 output.  It is not relevant to the ls00
output and needs to be ignored.  After this the bits need to be shifted over
by three.  Finally, a bit mask needs to be created so that only the appropriate
output bits are considered.  This is four for the ls00 and five for the ls138.

The key to setting up the test cases for the ls138 is realizing that most of
the test cases have an output of 0x1f.  Whenever the three most significant
bits are not 001, the output is 0x1f.  After that there are only 8 other cases
to consider, so simple boolean logic can be used to test the data.

All of the tests involved in mp5 dealt with monitoring and manipulating the
various pins.  The ls175 would be a more subtle and thus more difficulty chip
to test because of the number of pins that are required to be tested and the
considerations that need to be made for how the pins operate.  The clock pulse
pin would be the most difficult pin to deal with.

Any algorothm testing the clock pulse would not only have to test the result
of the response to the clock pulse edge, but it would also have to test what
happens to input when data is entered before the clock pulse, as well as what
happens if the data is entered during the clock pulse but not during the
appropriate edge, and it must also test to see what happens to data after and
in between clock pulses.  It would be necessary to insure that any
instructions that were utilized coordinated with the proper timing patterns of
the clock pulse.

Moreover, it would also be necessary to test the state of the flip-flops
before, after, and in between clock pulses.  There would be a requirement to
test the outputs as well as their complements and it would be necessary to
test to make sure that the outputs were properly coordinated with each other.
In other words, it would be necessary to ensure that not only are the ouputs
and complements in their proper state, but it is also necessary to make sure
that they are in their proper state with respect to each other.

Finally, it is important not to forget that the master reset ought to be
tested.  And in order to ensure it is working properly, it would be necessary
to perform the reset when the ls175 is in every possible state that it could
be in.
